SPSS Kill switch
================

For more details please go to [SPSS Kill switch project page on hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/project/12378-spss-kill-switch)

This version will send WIN+CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+S keypress.

Autohotkey (script and compiled script included) expects that combination and will kill both _spssengine.exe_ and _stats.exe_ processes immediately.
